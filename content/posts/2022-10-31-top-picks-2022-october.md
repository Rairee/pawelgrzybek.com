## [Delightful UI Animations With Shared Element Transitions API (Part 1)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/10/ui-animations-shared-element-transitions-api-part1/)

Complicated transitions between two UI states are tough, and we often pull hefty third-party libraries to our projects to achieve it. However, this thing is about to change, thanks to Shared Element Transitions API. [Adrian Bece](https://twitter.com/AdrianBeceDev) published this article in Smashing Magazine that explains the complexity of the problem and shows how we can solve it using multiple practical examples (to-do list, image gallery, carousel and shop cart animation). It is almost hard to believe that these API is real — possibilities are endless, and the functionality is surprisingly easy to use.

## [Introducing OG Image Generation: Fast, dynamic social card images at the Edge](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images)

Custom open graph images can boost the engagement of your article by up to 40%. So it is worth paying a little attention to this and crafting a nice picture for the posts we spend a lot of energy on. This solution by the Vercel team looks very solid to me. I love how they made the full deployment of a tool like this to your own Vercel account with a single click. If you are curious about more in-depth technical details about the design process, look at the [series of tweets by one of the authors, Shu Ding](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1579607964549513217).


## [Style Queries](https://una.im/style-queries/)

Container queries barely landed in almost all browsers (at the time of writing this article, we are still waiting for Firefox support), so it is time for another type of CSS query. This post by [Una](https://twitter.com/una) is a top introduction to [Style Container Queries](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain-3/#container-style-query). What's most exciting about it is that you can combine container and style queries, which opens new possibilities for CSS. It is an excellent time to be a CSS developer!

## [Record & Tuple: immutable data structures in JS - Robin Ricard | NodeConf EU 2022](https://youtu.be/D_V0np5X0ww)

Records (`#{}`) and Tuples (`#[]`) are currently in stage 2 of the TC39 standardisation process, and maybe one day, we will see them being a part of the ECMAScript specification. One of the champions of this proposal, Robin Ricard, talked about this subject at NodeConf EU 2022. Quick, informative and well explained.
