Hugo is the tool that I use to statically generate this very website. It is extremely fast, configurable and comes with bunch of useful features. Added in version 0.62 [Markdown Render Hooks](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#markdown-render-hooks) are revolutionary. This feature allows to override default HTML markup generated by parsing Markdown links, headings and images.

The HTML `<picture>` element is very handy when we want to offer multiple image versions for different scenarios. It may specify some alternative version based on display resolution, screen density, operating system appearance mode and also provide the the most optimized file format based on the browser support.
