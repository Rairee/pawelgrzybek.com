## [Fastify v4 GA](https://medium.com/@fastifyjs/fastify-v4-ga-59f2103b5f0e)

My favourite Node.js framework just hit version 4. It comes with many great features and improvements like new error handling composition, typings out of the box, a bunch of router improvements, performance boost and a lot more. I look forward to updating one of my projects to use it.
