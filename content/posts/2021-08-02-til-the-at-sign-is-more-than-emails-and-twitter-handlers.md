It was an ordinary Saturday when my girlfriend and myself decided to visit [Abbey Pumping Station Museum in Leicester](https://www.leicestermuseums.org/abbey-pumping-station/) while waiting for the mechanic to fix our car. Massive beam engines to support local sewage systems and all that is super cool, but something that caught my attention was Moya No. 1 typewriter machine from 1902. Typewrites fascinate me a lot, but something that triggered my curiosity was the @ sign. Surely email addresses and Twitter were not a thing back then.

Like a typical millennial, I thought that [the @ sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign) is an invention of the 70s for email addresses and other protocols like SSH. Wrong assumption! The first discovered usage of @ character goes back to 1345, but it was popularized in the 16th century in Spain and Portugal as an abbreviation for the unit of weight, mass or volume ‚Äî [arroba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroba).

Funny, little known fact for y'all. In polish it is called "ma≈Çpa" which translates to "monkey". Yeah, literaly "example", "monkey", "gmail.com".

I asked three of my friends if they knew anything other than obvious modern usage about the @ sign. Nope! And that's why I decided to write this post down. Until next time, stay curious üßê
