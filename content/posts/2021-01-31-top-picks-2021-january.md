## [Maximally optimizing image loading for the web in 2021](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/image-optimizations/)

It is crazy how difficult it is to serve well-optimised image to the end-user, considering supporting image format, screen density, preferred operating system appearance mode and picture’s container size. Hopefully, the web platform will come with some less ridiculous-looking solution at some point, but for the time being, we have to follow every single advice given by [Malte Ubl](https://twitter.com/cramforce).

## [Webbed Briefs](https://briefs.video)

I love [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) for his expertise in web development and his sense of humour. His new idea is another masterpiece — a vlog that is not on YouTube. It is all about web and accessible only on the canonical website (nope, you cannot embed his videos — brilliant idea). I instantly subscribed this website using my RSS reader.

## [Figma Crash](https://www.figmacrashcourse.com)

[Pablo Stanley](https://twitter.com/pablostanley) created another amazing resource to help you to master Figma. For the time being the part about the Auto Layout is ready. More to come in 2021: Illustration Systems, Animation & Prototyping and also Components & Systems. This is probably the best resource to pick up more advanced parts of this tool.
