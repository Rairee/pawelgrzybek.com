I have had a great time co-creating [Semble (formerly Heydoc)](https://www.semble.io) for the past nine months. It was a pleasure to build software that helps thousands of doctors around the UK. But unfortunately, some internal difficulties arose a few weeks ago that perfectly synced with the hard-to-decline offer I received.

I am happy to share that I am joining [Polygon](https://polygon.technology) as a Software Engineer. I am over the moon going back to something that got me into the biggest passion of my life — frontend development. I will also have an excellent opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and dip my toes into programming languages that I have never had a chance to use professionally — Go and Rust.

I look forward to joining a new bunch of decentralisation freaks and meeting them all in Istambul in just a few days.
