## [Introducing Insomnia Designer](https://insomnia.rest/blog/introducing-designer)

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) is my favourite REST API client. I am very excited about just announced Insomnia Designer — a tool to help us edit and share [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). It is looking polished, well-though piece of software, just like the Insomnia Core.
