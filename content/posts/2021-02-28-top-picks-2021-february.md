## [npm 7 is now generally available!](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/)

Version 7 of the official node package manager arrived with bunch of improvements and one changes that I am excited about. Reducing dependencies, increased code coverage, significant performance improvements and compatibility with `yarn`. Sweet!
