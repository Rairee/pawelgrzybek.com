## [npm 7 is now generally available!](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/)

Version 7 of the official node package manager arrived with a bunch of improvements and one change that I am excited to see — reducing dependencies, increased code coverage, significant performance improvements and compatibility with yarn. Sweet!

## [AWS Lambda now supports Node.js 14](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/aws-lambda-now-supports-node-js-14/)

Upgrade to node version 14 is a significant change that will make our life a lot easier. Some of the new features that we just got to our disposal are nullish coalescing, optional chaining, and many new options on Intl constructor. Indeed the upgrade to the V8.1 engine comes with a lot of performance improvements too.
