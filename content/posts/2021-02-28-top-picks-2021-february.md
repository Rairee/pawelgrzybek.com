## [npm 7 is now generally available!](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/)

Version 7 of the official node package manager arrived with a bunch of improvements and one change that I am excited to see â€” reducing dependencies, increased code coverage, significant performance improvements and compatibility with yarn. Sweet!

## [AWS Lambda now supports Node.js 14](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/02/aws-lambda-now-supports-node-js-14/)

Upgrade to node version 14 is a significant change that will make our life a lot easier.

Indeed the upgrade to the V8.1 engine comes with a lot of performance improvements too.

##  [Modular AWS SDK for JavaScript is now generally available](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-aws-sdk-for-javascript-is-now-generally-available/)

Another big news for JavaScript developers using AWS cloud. The official SDK got a big update on December. The package is modular and allows to import only whats needed instead of the whole SDK, comes with a native support for TypeScript and introduces revamped middleware system. 

## [The "ping" attribute on <a> tags, which will send a POST request to the given URLs when the anchor is clicked](https://twitter.com/svenluijten/status/1363245229533507585)

## [Ray.so â€” Create beautiful images of your code](https://ray.so)

It is like [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) but applies slightly different look. I really like both of these tools to use when I want to share a snippet of code on Twitter.
