## [button elements offer attributes to change form behavior](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/button-elements-offer-attributes-to-change-form-behavior/)

By default, `button` within `form` element sends a `POST` request to the form's action URL with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoded data as long as the inuts values are valid.

## [AWS Lambda now supports event filtering for Amazon SQS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Kinesis as event sources](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-lambda-event-filtering-amazon-sqs-dynamodb-kinesis-sources/)

This announcement can save you or your company a lot of money. With this feature, there is no need to write a separate logic to filter kinds of events on a Lambda level. Events of interest can be caputred on a config level, and for the one that are not of interest, they can be ifgnored. No need to invoke function at all. So helpful.
