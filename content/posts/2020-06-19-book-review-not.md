My 30th birthday was the last time when I felt great in my own body. My 33rd birthday is coming soon and I promised myself that I am going to feel great with myself again. Apart from changing my diet habits and being much more active, I try to educate myself on how to do it healthily.

I came across ["Not a Diet Book" by  James Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49477059-not-a-diet-book) accidentally while browsing Audible library. Turns out that his publication was a great choice.

James book is a very verbose way of saying "eat less than you burn". It is filled with scientific facts and filtered out off silver bullet marketing bullshit. Apart from formal knowledge good chunk of this book contains the valuable experience of a personal trainer who is focused on making people lives better. The truth about the keto diet (that I was a big fan of for years), clean food, macros and our body internal behaviours involved in fat loss. Educational and inspirational dense to the point that you better read/listen to it with a fresh mind.
