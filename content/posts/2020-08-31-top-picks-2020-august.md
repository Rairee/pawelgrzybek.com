## [Announcing the new TypeScript Website](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-the-new-typescript-website/)

New website looks great but for me most important part of this announcement is a new documentation. So part of the previous handbook were so out dated. I am really happy to see all to be like it should in 2020, bunch of great explainers and new playground.

## [Introducing Rome](https://romefrontend.dev/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html)

This is exciting news. Rome — the toolchain for frontend projects made by Facebook team that is going to combine tools like Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Jest and others into a single dependency. This sounds like a dream. No more hours spent on setting up Prettier that speaks well to ESLint, no more hours spent on Webpack documentation and no more wasted time on Jest configuration to make it work smoothly with Jest. Currently Rome supports only linting part but we should expect the list of features growing very soon.
