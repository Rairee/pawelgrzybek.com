## [Announcing the new TypeScript Website](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-the-new-typescript-website/)

New website looks great but for me most important part of this announcement is a new documentation. So part of the previous handbook were so out dated. I am really happy to see all to be like it should in 2020, bunch of great explainers and new playground.
