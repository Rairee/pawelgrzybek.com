I am an Apple fan boy. I watch all the live software and product announcements. Mac Pro is probably the only piece of hardware made by this company that I have never owned. I glorify the design choices by this company (apart from the Magic Mouse 2nd generation) and celebrate opening the box with new goodies every once in a while.

To fully earn "Apple fanboy" label I had to find out a bit more about the history of a company and its founder. I couldn't pick any better than ["Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography" by Walter Isaacson](#) to fulfill my curiosity, could I?

First things first â€” Walter Isaacson is the author of the best biography book that I have ever read. It is a very compelling read about the genius and the biggest asshat under the moon. From his childhood, throughout education, projects up to the loosing the battle with cancer. It is about perfectionism, striving for simplicity and perfect products built to make clients life easier and for profit as a secondary goal. The story expresses Steves difficult personality dominated by his reality distortion. It is about his believes, controversial diet habits and his relationships.

I would highly recommend this book not only to Apple fans, but to everyone who needs an inspirational kick in their life. Lengthy, captivating story of an asshole genius.
