As you would expect from a passionate geek, I love books about programming, but I also enjoy reads about self-development. It is hard to find a combination of these two categories in one publication, but I found one, and I can't recommend it enough - ["The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer).

I heard about this book a lot in the past, and I regret that I didn't pick this one up at the earlier stage of my career. This book contains 53 topics about the specific aspects of software developers' everyday lives, from high-level subjects like communication to very detailed recommendations about writing good testable code. You can tell that the authors are two experienced programmers who value practicality over theoretical gibberish.

As said before, I consider this book a must-read for everyone working in this field. So, let me leave you with the last tip from this book and for sure the most important one.
