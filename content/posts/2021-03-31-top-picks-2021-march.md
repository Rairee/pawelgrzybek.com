## [free-for.dev](https://free-for.dev/)

Every single possible service for developers that offers a free tier in one extensive list put together by [R.I.Pienaar](https://twitter.com/ripienaar). I love little helper pages like this one.

## [Icons - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

You can now download Material Design Icons straight from the Google Fonts website. It is one of the best designed icons set ever created and now more accessible then ever before. Thanks Google making that easy.

## [Global Privacy Control (GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org)

Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It helps users signal their desired privacy to websites and services, just by using their browser. There is number of products that come with GPC implementation and I would expect more to come soon. From implementation point of view, `Sec-GPC` header is all you need to signal that the user's Global Privacy Control preference is set. Check more details in [GCP specification](https://globalprivacycontrol.github.io/gpc-spec/).
