## [Goodbye \#TypeScript (going back to \#JavaScript)](https://youtu.be/ytWbqnppzyc)

This title is a super clickbaity, but it was released on the 1st of April (April Fool’s Day), and it is about moving from TypeScript to JavaScript. Of course, the title is a joke, but the video is excellent and valuable. [Basarad Ali Syed](https://twitter.com/basarat) gives us a list of good recommendations on how we can write JavaScript in a type-safe manner if, for some reason, using TypeScript is not an option.

## [AWS Lambda Function URLs: built-in HTTPS endpoints for your Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-lambda-function-urls-built-in-https-endpoints-for-single-function-microservices/)

HTTPS endpoints finally arrived. Not every Lambda needs to be a part of an advanced microservice build using many AWS services. Sometimes we need a simple webhook to trigger a Lambda function. Previously it wasn't an easy task and required a lot of configuration. Creating a new secure endpoint and attaching some CORS configuration is easier than ever with this new feature.

## [A Complete Guide to CSS Cascade Layers](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/)

The CSS Cascade Layers are the second most exciting thing in modern CSS (Container Queries winning here). This comprehensive guide by [Miriam Suzanne](https://twitter.com/TerribleMia) is insanely detailed and covers everything that you would like to know about this feature. It also helped me to understand how `!important` keyword works.

## [CSS :has( ) A Parent Selector Now](https://matthiasott.com/notes/css-has-a-parent-selector-now)

This article by [Matthias Ott](https://twitter.com/m_ott) is so good. Great explanation of the new `:has()` pseudo-class and many practical examples. After reading this one, I finally understood the whole excitement about this feature.

## [Announcing TypeScript 4.7 Beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/)

This is the TypeScript release that you should be excited about. Microsoft team worked very hard to add support to ECMAScript modules, and the implementation looks very well-thought. Things like new extensions (`.mts` and `.cts`) map directly to the ECMAScript modules implementation. This anouncement reveals a lot of nuances and of cours goes in depth about other features released in this cycle.

## [CSS Parent Selector](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-has-parent-selector/)

Another great post about recently popular CSS `:has()` pseudo-class. [Ahmad Shadeed](https://twitter.com/shadeed9) helps us understand the concept of this new feature by translating complicated selectors into a plain english. Also, the list of use-cases is impressive. Very nice read!
