## [Pluralsight to Acquire A Cloud Guru to Accelerate Solving the Single Biggest Challenge in IT Today: The Growing Cloud Skills Gap](https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/pluralsight-to-acquire-a-cloud-guru)

It was not long time ago when A Cloud Guru acquired The Linux Academy making their product even stronger. Now, bigger player came into the game to acquires A Cloud Guru — Pluralsight. In my humble opinion, we have a clear winner in terms of online learning platforms now, and this announcement make my opinion even stronger. Pluralsight has a lot of very high quality course not only for beginner and mid level engineers, but also very advanced materials for senior level programmers. I am very excited about this news and looking forward to the future of this platform.

## [Introducing Astro: Ship Less JavaScript](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro)

Bring your own framework (BYOF), 100% static, on-demand components, fully-featured and SEO are the main core design principals followed by developers who build Astro. It is a new generation of static site generators that cherry-picked the best parts form other popular tools of this category like Eleventy, Hugo, or Jekyll. It is worth to pay attention to it, because everything built by [Fred K. Schott](https://twitter.com/FredKSchott) is rather revolutionary.

## [WebKit Features in Safari at WWDC21](https://webkit.org/blog/11700/webkit-features-in-safari-at-wwdc21/)

Safari 15 announced on WWDC2021 is a revolutionary release. Totally revamped design, new web inspector, great number of new features. You can read all about the subject on this handy page that puts together all things to be expected soon into on page. A talk from WWDC is attached to every single one of the subjects here. Since Safari is my daily driver for bot systems (macOS and iOS) I am looking forward to this release.

## [Next.js 11](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11)

Next.js team doesn't stop — the new version is coming with bunch of improvements to make sure you never compromise performance, security, and accessibility. ESLint support out of the box, script optimization using `next/script` component, automatic images size detection using `<Image />` component, image placeholders. CRA (create react app ) migration is a crazy cool idea! Probably the most hyper feature is the Next.js Live — preview releases with amazing collaboration features. I think it will be the future of passing feedback about the web projects soon.
