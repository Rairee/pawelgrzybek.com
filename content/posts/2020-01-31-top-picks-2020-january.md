## [TSConf 2019 - Watch the Whole Conference](https://tsconf.io/videos.html)

All talks from TSConf 2019 are now online. They are all very insightful and I highly encourage you to watch them all. If you have no time and want to pick just one — "Deno is a New Way to JavaScript" by Ryan Dahl & Kitson Kelly would be my pick.

## [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)

[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) from React core team explains why striving for the cleanest and "DRYiest" implementation of your new feature is not always the best idea.

## [Animate text along a path on scroll](https://youtu.be/Tae96ze3xwY)

[Stephen Shaw](https://twitter.com/shshaw) from [the @keyframers](https://twitter.com/keyframers) team gives a quick and concise explanation to animate text along the svg path on scroll event. Neat and simple method.

## [New year, new browser – The new Microsoft Edge is out of preview and now available for download](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/01/15/new-year-new-browser-the-new-microsoft-edge-is-out-of-preview-and-now-available-for-download/)

Finally landed — Microsoft Edge based on Chromium engine is officially announced. Am I happy about it? I don't know. I am a bit skeptical about a single engine that drives them all and that probably explains the reason why I am such a big fun of Mozilla politics and day-in-day-out Safari user. One thing became much easier though — frontend development.

## [JetBrains Mono: A free and open source typeface for developers](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

Free, open-source typeface for developers from JetBrains. Increased height for a better reading experience, adapted to reading code and supports ligatures. Ready to be used in your code editor, on your next poster design, website and mobile app. You can even design your own font based on it. Sick!
