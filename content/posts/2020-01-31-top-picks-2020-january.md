## [TSConf 2019 - Watch the Whole Conference](https://tsconf.io/videos.html)

All talks from TSConf 2019 are now online. They are all very insightful and I highly encourage you to watch them all. If you have no time and want to pick just one — "Deno is a New Way to JavaScript" by Ryan Dahl & Kitson Kelly would be my pick.
