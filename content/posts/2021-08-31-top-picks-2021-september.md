## [An Introduction to JQ](https://earthly.dev/blog/jq-select/)

The `jq` command-line utility is a defacto solution for querying JSON data. It is lightweight, fast, available for all operating systems and pretty easy to use. This guide by [Adam Gordon Bell](https://twitter.com/adamgordonbell) is a good cheat sheet for using it.

## [An update to how we generate web page titles](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/08/update-to-generating-page-titles)

Does Google "break the Web" again by changing the way how page titles are generated? Is it a good or a bad change in your opinion? I have to admit that I am not a big fan of ignoring the `title` tag, but I am a big fan of emphasising the HTML `h1` tag.

## [htmlq](https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq)

Like jq, but for HTML. Really nice super project. I see more and more Rust based projects that blow my mind recently.

## [The Future of CSS: Cascade Layers (CSS @layer)](https://www.bram.us/2021/09/15/the-future-of-css-cascade-layers-css-at-layer/)

Braum published a great primer to the CSS Cascade Layers. New CSS feature lead by Miriam Suzane that is going to improve the way how we deal with CSS order, specificity, context etc. I love to see this kind of additions being worked on. 

## [Designing Beautiful Shadows in CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/)

If you think you know everything about CSS `box-shadow`, give this one a go. It is amazing, interactive post that goes into depth of life-like looking shadows by [Joshw Comeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau).

## [Mastering Serverless Application Observability](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJo-rJlep0EDiN3pPjBDUfq34BqMAI_o-)

This course on Serverless Observability by [Julian Wood](https://twitter.com/julian_wood) is a top resource for everyone new to the world of micro-services. From basinc introduction of core observability pilars (metrics, logs and tracing) up to the advanced concepts of monitoring. Well spent one hour of your time.
