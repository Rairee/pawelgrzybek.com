Yes, ["Peter Pan"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34268.Peter_Pan), a kids book. It is not me being childish, it is you being boring — sorry for being brutally honest. After the last decade that I spent on reading serious, mature, programming and science-related books I decided to re-experience the feeling of children book. I don't regret this decision and I am sure I am going to read more toddler novels soon.

Peter Pan brought me to the higher level of fantasy and imagination than any other story that I read/listened in last few years. World of speaking trees, grumpy fairies, flying boys who never want to grow up — everything that I need. Despite the fact that the audiobook version that I listened to varies slightly from the original version from 1911 it delivers a great recipe to forget about the system around us. On top of it ["Peter Pan" on Audible](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Peter-Pan-Audiobook/B081HH7XNL) was for free a few weeks ago.
