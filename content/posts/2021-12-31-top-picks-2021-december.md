## [Amazon S3 Glacier storage class is now Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval; storage price reduced by 10% and bulk retrievals are now free](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-storage-class-amazon-s3-glacier-flexible-retrieval/)

Amazon S3 Glacier is one of my favourite products from the Amazon platform. I use it as my personal backup solution that I wrote about in ["My Amazon S3 photo backup solution"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/) article. This year on AWS reInvent, [new storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-instant-retrieval-storage-class/) has been announced, but also a massive cost reduction of already existing storage class. I am well excited about it because by doing nothing, I am saving money. If you are looking for a solution for personal long-term cold backup, do not hesitate and consider using Amazon S3 Glacier.

## [Amazon SQS Enhances Dead-letter Queue Management Experience For Standard Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sqs-dead-letter-queue-management-experience-queues/)

Another announcement from reInvent 2021. This feature helps a lot to redirect failed events from DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) to another queue. This process was possible before but required a lot of manual tweaking and multi-step procedures. Not it is as simple as clicking a button. Very great feature for all maintainers of serverless infrastructures.
