## [Amazon S3 Glacier storage class is now Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval; storage price reduced by 10% and bulk retrievals are now free](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-storage-class-amazon-s3-glacier-flexible-retrieval/)

Amazon S3 Glacier is one of my favourite products from the Amazon platform. I use it as my personal backup solution that I wrote about in ["My Amazon S3 photo backup solution"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/) article. This year on AWS reInvent, [new storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-instant-retrieval-storage-class/) has been announced, but also a massive cost reduction of already existing storage class. I am well excited about it because by doing nothing, I am saving money. If you are looking for a solution for personal long-term cold backup, do not hesitate and consider using Amazon S3 Glacier.

## [Amazon SQS Enhances Dead-letter Queue Management Experience For Standard Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sqs-dead-letter-queue-management-experience-queues/)

Another announcement from reInvent 2021. This feature helps a lot to redirect failed events from DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) to another queue. This process was possible before but required a lot of manual tweaking and multi-step procedures. Not it is as simple as clicking a button. Very great feature for all maintainers of server-less infrastructures.

## [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) v2 is now generally available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/aws-cloud-development-kit-cdk-generally-available/)

Yeah! Another AWS news (sorry if thats not your thing). AWS Cloud Development Kit v2 is now generally available and it comes with bunch of great DX improvements. All top level constructs are now accessible from a single dependency and there is no need to import everything individually. 

## [Improving GitHub code search](https://github.blog/2021-12-08-improving-github-code-search/)

This new experience of browsing code across GitHub repositories looks appealing to me. Maybe with this tool browsing open source packages will become a little bit less scary. Another good application of Rust language. Also, have a look at the promo website for new [GitHub Code Search](https://cs.github.com/about), absolutely gorgeous.

## [Understanding re-rendering and memoization in React](https://engineering.udacity.com/understanding-re-rendering-and-memoization-in-react-13e8c024c2b4)

This is the best explanation of re-rendering and memoization of React components that I have read so far. Thanks to Kolby Sisk — ht really has a great skill of explaining difficult things using simple words. I love this style.

## [Deno joins TC39](https://deno.com/blog/deno-joins-tc39)

I am excited that Deno representant, [Luca Casonato](https://twitter.com/lcasdev), will be joining regulat TC39 meetings. The goal is to make server-side JavaScript even more powerful with a strong push on features like non-JS assets in the ES module graph, explicit resource management and better standard library.

## [Tailwind CSS v3.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3)

Tailwind 3.0 is here and there is a lot of new features coming with that versoin. Scroll-snap suppport, multi-column layout, native form controls, print stylesheets, aspect ratio, RTL modifiers and more. Even tho I am not a big Tailwind user, this looks like a super exciting announcement for die-hard Tailwind fans. Also, look at this promo video!

## [The CSS "content" property accepts alternative text](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/css-content-accepts-alternative-text/)

This is one of the most shocking accessibility related articles that I read recently. I didn;t have a clue that an alternative text in CSS `content` property is a thing. Also, CSS `alt` property is a new thing for me. Very great read by [Stefan Judis](stefanjudis).

## [Lists are now available as a public beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-09-lists-are-now-available-as-a-public-beta/)

For me this is one of the nicest features that GiHub team added recently. You can now organize your starred prjects into predefined categories. My mess of hundreds interesting projects is over, now I can organize them into groups.
