## [Introducing Insomnia Designer](https://insomnia.rest/blog/introducing-designer)

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) is my favourite REST API client. I am very excited about just announced Insomnia Designer — a tool to help us edit and share [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). It is looking polished, well-though piece of software, just like the Insomnia Core.

## [GitHub Codespaces — Your instant dev environment](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

Another month and another big announcement from GitHub team. The full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub website. Really full experience — code, build, debug, manage plugins, install dependencies etc. Always accessible in your browser. List of an early-access testers is open and I cannot wait to try it out.
