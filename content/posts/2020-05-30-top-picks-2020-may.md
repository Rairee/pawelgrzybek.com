## [Introducing Insomnia Designer](https://insomnia.rest/blog/introducing-designer)

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) is my favourite REST API client. I am very excited about just announced Insomnia Designer — a tool to help us edit and share [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). It is looking polished, well-though piece of software, just like the Insomnia Core.

## [GitHub Codespaces — Your instant dev environment](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

Another month and another big announcement from GitHub team. The full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub website. Really full experience — code, build, debug, manage plugins, install dependencies etc. Always accessible in your browser. List of an early-access testers is open and I cannot wait to try it out. There is a bunch more cool stuff announced on GitHub Satellite 2020. Have a look at this [short video by Bytesized](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC046lFvJZhiwSRWsoH8SFjg) that summarized all new features in 15 minutes.

The ability to combine logical operations with assignment has always been missing in JavaScript language. Until now! This short article by [Shu-yu Guo](https://twitter.com/_shu) explains everything that you have to know about the subject.

## [Exciting Things on the Horizon For CSS Layout](https://css-irl.info/exciting-things-on-the-horizon-for-css-layout/)

Quick summary of cool layout features that are coming to CSS specification soon. Thanks for sharing [Michelle Barker](https://twitter.com/MicheBarks).

## [Deno 1.0](https://deno.land/v1)

It is official now. First version of new JavaScript runtime hit a stable v1. Decentralized modules / plugins support, Promise based API, easy to understand permission system, TypeScript support and without bad design decisions included in Node.js. This is worth to follow.
