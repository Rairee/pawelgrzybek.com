## [Agile & Scrum Don't Work | Allen Holub In The Engineering Room Ep. 9](https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU)

This is a fascinating conversation between two mature software engineers about the “agile” ways of working nowadays and why it is widely misinterpreted. I became a fan of Allen after this interview. After listening to this interview, one of the great resources worth checking is Allen’s ["Heuristics for Effective Organizations: A continuously evolving list"](https://holub.com/heuristics/). It may be controversial to business-oriented people, but it is worth sharing with your colleagues.
