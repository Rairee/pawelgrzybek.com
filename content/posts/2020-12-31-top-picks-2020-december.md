## [State of CSS 2020 survey](https://2020.stateofcss.com/)

The results of the annual CSS survey are ready. It is pretty shocking how changeable this territory is over the last decade. It is nice to see a growing number of participants and the rapid adoption of modern CSS features like CSS grid that exploded in 2020. It is nice to see very wide adoption of frameworks like Tailwind. Another realization — I am shocked that only 11.3% of participants test using a screen reader. I would love this proportion to be changed next year as I observe a great interest in accessibility recently. in general, it is full of very interesting insights worth exploring. Thanks for putting this thing together [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif) and [Raphaël Benitte](https://twitter.com/benitteraphael).
