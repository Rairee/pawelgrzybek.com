## [Working with the file system on Node.js](https://2ality.com/2022/06/nodejs-file-system.html)

This `fs` module guide by [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) is everything you need to grasp the basics of working with files system in Node.js. Even though I felt I was already familiar with it, I still learned much from this resource. I will surely use this article as a reference in the future.

## [m-cli](https://github.com/rgcr/m-cli)

This repository is the “swiss army knife for macOS” under the one homebrew package. I spent hours reading the source code for this CLI tool. If you are a fan of making some macOS changes using Terminal, you will appreciate the fact that this is just a wrapper on top of simple shell or Apple Script commands. Very nice project.

## [Software Over Time](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/software-over-time/)

A food for thoughts. I really like to keep in mind what Jim said every time i add additional complexity or extra abstraction to the codebase that I collaborate on with others.

> Responding to change in year one of the business as quickly as in year ten of the business would be a phenomenal feat. All companies accumulate complexity over time, which is a weight you drag with you.
