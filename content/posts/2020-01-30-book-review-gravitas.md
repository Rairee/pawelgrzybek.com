I am a constant joker. Most often there is nothing bad about it but as a holder of senior-level role in big software company some level of seriousness can be helpful. The power of great communicators lies somewhere in between, isn't it? I decided to dedicate some time to find the sweet spot and picked up ["Gravitas: Communicate with Confidence, Influence and Authority" by Caroline Goyder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18685594-gravitas). It was a great choice!

It is a combination of bite-size chapters about multiple subjects involved in finding your own "gravitas". A great read for everyone willing to enhance influence, become a better writer, public speaker or presented. It is well written but for fans of audiobooks, I can assure you that Caroline's voice on Audible version is pleasant and easy to listen. Until next time, bye :-*
