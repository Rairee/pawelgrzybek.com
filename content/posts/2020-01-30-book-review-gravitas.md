I can't help it â€” I am a constant joker. It is not a bad thing in majority of situations, but as a senior level role holder in big software company some level of seriousness is helpful. It is all about balancing these two, isn't it? I decided to dedicated some time to work on this finding this sweet spot between these two extreme personas inside myself. ["Gravitas: Communicate with Confidence, Influence and Authority" by Caroline Goyder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18685594-gravitas) sounds exactly like something that I need in my life.

Each chapter of this book is a list of recipes and practical exercises to help you to find your "gravitas". I found a tons of great advices that will hopefully make me better writer, communicator and public speaker.
