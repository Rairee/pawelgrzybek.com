## [Building the Web We Want](https://css-tricks.com/building-the-web-we-want/)

New initiative in collaboration with Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Samsung Internet and Igalia committed to make the open web a better place. Since now on, this fantastic movement can be supported by the web community, called [The Web We Want](https://webwewant.fyi). This article on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) elaborates about the idea and explains how to get involved.

## [HTTPS Is Easy!](https://httpsiseasy.com)

A little guide by amazing [Troy Hunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt) about the HTTPS configuration with CloudFlare. Subjects like fully encrypted SSL, automatic rewrites, TLS and HSTS are very well explained. I love all the things that Troy is doing for web platform.

## [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/)

Brand new JavaScript bundler written entirely in go language. First comparison to industry standard tools is looking very promising. Space worth to follow.

## [Announcing TypeScript 3.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/)

This release looks rather revolutionary to me. Something that I struggled with a lot in my current project has now been resolved by type-only imports and exports. Another game changes is top level await implemented in the same manner like it is in modern runtimes (Chromium dev tools for example). ECMAScript native private class fields number of new possibilities too. Very solid release that you want to use on your project.
