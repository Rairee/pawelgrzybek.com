## [Light Years Ahead | The 1969 Apollo Guidance Computer](https://youtu.be/B1J2RMorJXM)

On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong with the crew landed humans on the moon for the first time. Even though it was more than half a century ago, the computer responsible for controlling the command module was one of the most complicated pieces of technology at the time. Software loaded on it was also very sophisticated, and it was built by following a number of core design principles.
On this fantastic talk given in 2019 at the National Museum of Computing, Robert Wills walks us through hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer.
