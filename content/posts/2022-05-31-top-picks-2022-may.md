## [Moving a macOS window by clicking anywhere on it (like on Linux)](https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2022-04-16-drag-window-by-clicking-anywhere-on-macos/)

The macOS is full of hidden gems that are configurable only via CLI (hidden from the System preferences UI). For example, this command enables moving an app by holding <kbd>Cmd + Ctrl</kbd>and dragging the window. Not a new thing for die-hard Linux users. Thank you for sharing [Matteo](https://twitter.com/mazzarolomatteo).

## [A Community Group for Web-interoperable JavaScript runtimes](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-wintercg/)

This article on the Cloudflare blog introduces [Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group (WinterCG)](https://wintercg.org), a new community group focused on improving the interoperability of web platform APIs across runtimes (especially non-browser ones). Something like W3C but for other runtimes. A significant announcement, and I hope that job of developers targeting Node.js, Deno and Cloudflare Workers will become easier.

## [What's new for the web platform](https://youtu.be/5b4YcLB4DVI)

One of these presentations that I wait for every year. [Una](https://twitter.com/Una) and [Jake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) from Google Web Platform team presented to us a number of new fewtures that are coming to the Web. Some of them I know and even use on production already with an appropriate fallback, but a few of them are absolutely new to me. The new COLRv1 font format in combination with new CSS `size-adjust` is a very powerful method to display and control web fonts. ITNP (interaction to next paint) is a new metric that Google team is experimenting with, and in my opinion it is much more valuable than the time to first interaction. Good presentation overall.

## [Roboto … But Make It Flex](https://material.io/blog/roboto-flex)

Roboto, the default font used on Android and probably the most popular font ever, got a significant update. Roboto goes flex, which means that there is finally a variable version of this font face. It gives users crazy 12 axes to play with and adjust to their taste. Roboto Flex is probably the most configurable font that I have ever seen. If you are too lazy to read the whole blog post, at least check this promo video. It is sick!

## [Node.js 16.x runtime now available in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/node-js-16-x-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/)

It finally landed. Node.js 16 runtime support for AWS Lambdas is here. New ECMAScript features are just a partial reason why you should be excited. For example, combining [provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) with top-level await can give you a significant performance boost.

## [What the useEvent React hook is (and isn't)](https://typeofnan.dev/what-the-useevent-react-hook-is-and-isnt/)

A few days ago, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) published a [proposal for the new useEvent() hook](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/useevent/text/0000-useevent.md). This feature can reduce re-renders of React components. Dan provides several good examples in his document. The article that I am recommending today is a very brief explanation of the new feature and the problem it is trying to solve by [Nick Scialli](https://twitter.com/nas5w) from SolidJS core team.
