## [Moving a macOS window by clicking anywhere on it (like on Linux)](https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2022-04-16-drag-window-by-clicking-anywhere-on-macos/)

The macOS is full of hidden gems that are configurable only via CLI (hidden from the System preferences UI). For example, this command enables moving an app by holding <kbd>Cmd + Ctrl</kbd>and dragging the window. Not a new thing for die-hard Linux users. Thank you for sharing [Matteo](https://twitter.com/mazzarolomatteo).
