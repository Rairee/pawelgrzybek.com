## [Moving a macOS window by clicking anywhere on it (like on Linux)](https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2022-04-16-drag-window-by-clicking-anywhere-on-macos/)

The macOS is full of hidden gems that are configurable only via CLI (hidden from the System preferences UI). For example, this command enables moving an app by holding <kbd>Cmd + Ctrl</kbd>and dragging the window. Not a new thing for die-hard Linux users. Thank you for sharing [Matteo](https://twitter.com/mazzarolomatteo).

## [A Community Group for Web-interoperable JavaScript runtimes](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-wintercg/)

This article on the Cloudflare blog introduces [Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group (WinterCG)](https://wintercg.org), a new community group focused on improving the interoperability of web platform APIs across runtimes (especially non-browser ones). Something like W3C but for other runtimes. A significant announcement, and I hope that job of developers targeting Node.js, Deno and Cloudflare Workers will become easier.
