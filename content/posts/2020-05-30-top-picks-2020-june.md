## [The Last of Us Part II isn’t just Naughty Dog’s most ambitious game — it’s the most accessible, too](https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4)

It is fantastic to see that accessibility features are considered early in a process of a game creation, not like an after thought that very often happens in a tech industry. Naughty Dog did an amazing job by introducing a plethora of features like high-contrast mode or magnification feature. I am not a big gamer, but this one I pre-ordered months ago. After reading this I appreciate the masterpiece of this title even more.
