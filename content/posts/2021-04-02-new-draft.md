One of the most revolutionary features introduced as part of ECMAScript 2015 specification is modules (ESM). The first browser implementation landed on April 2017 in Safari 10.1. I published a ["Native ECMAScript modules in the browser"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/native-ecmascript-modules-in-the-browser/) about this historical moment. A few months later, in September 2017, [Node v8.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.5.0/) landed with experimental support for ESM.

This feature went through lots of iterations during its experimental phase, and no one adopted it on day one. A few years later, in April 2020, [Node v14.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.0.0/) landed without experimental modules warning. Even though it was still experimental, that was the point in time when I adopted ESM for some toy projects and insignificant clients' work. Eventually, [Node v15.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v15.3.0/) arrived and marked modules implementation as stable.

That's enough of history, lets get our hands dirty and dive into the ECMAScrpit modules in Node.js. I am going to split this article into few meaningful sections.

## Enabling ECMAScript modules (ESM) in Node.js

To preserve backward compatibility Node.js treats JavaScript code as CommonJS modules by default. To enable ESM we have three options.

- use `.mjs` extension
- add `"type": "module"` to `package.json` file
- use `--input-type=module` flag
