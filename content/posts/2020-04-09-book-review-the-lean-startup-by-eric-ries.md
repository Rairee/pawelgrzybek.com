Inspired by ["How to Start a Side Hustle as a Programmer with Mani Vaya" episode](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-427-how-to-start-a-side-hustle-as-a-programmer-with-mani-vaya/) by [JavaScript Jabber podcast](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) I decided to read an entrepreneurship book. Despite that "business" is not a number one category of books that I would normally reach for, sometimes it is good to diverge and embrace a project development from the other perspective. After hearing about ["The Lean Startup" by Eric Reis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) time after time I decided to finally give it a go.

"The Lean Startup" is easy to read/listen publication full of great tips applicable for bedroom programmer baking first side hassle but also for a group of serious-looking professionals making millions-worth decisions in a boardroom. From the concept of MVP (Minimal Viable Product), through the quick iteration cycle, A/B testing, "Five Whys Rule" to the very high-level considerations about the role of a startup on a market. Although it is written by an entrepreneur with a software development background, insights from this book are very useful regardless of the industry. I highly recommend this book not only to people interested in starting a new startup but also to everyone who is involved in the process of a building a quality product.
