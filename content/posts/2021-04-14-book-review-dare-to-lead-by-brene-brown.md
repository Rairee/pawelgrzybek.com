At the beginning of a year, I got promoted to a position of Lead Software Engineer at [Mindera](https://mindera.com). When I accepted this position, I didn't realize what I am putting onto my shoulders. From being a developer, writing code all day long solving business problems using programming languages to mentorship and leading other developers to solve these problems. Even tho I feel more comfortable with it now, the transition wasn't easy and I still have plenty to learn.

Few weeks ago I saw a LinkedIn post by my friend [Luís Alberto Simões
](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisalbertosimoes/), where he recommended ["Dare to Lead" by Brené Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead). I learned a ton from Luis in the past who at Mindera is a go-to person when it comes to any soft skills development. After his brief review I knew that this is a book that can help me a lot in my new professional situation. It was a solid decision to pick it up.
