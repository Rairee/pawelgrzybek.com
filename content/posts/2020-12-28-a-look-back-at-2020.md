Who would have though that this year is going to be a little bit different. Exactly year ago, at the beginning of 2020, I was certain that this is going to be the best year of my life. Even tho we had a lot of madness going on, I delivered my presumption. I managed to make 2020 the best year of my life. After ["A look back at 2016"](/a-look-back-at-2016/), ["A look back at 2017"](/a-look-back-at-2017/), ["A look back at 2018"](/a-look-back-at-2018/) and ["A look back at 2019"](/a-look-back-at-2019/), it is time to compile the list of my personal and professional accomplishments from the past year.
