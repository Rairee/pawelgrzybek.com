Like I did in [2016](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2016/), [2017](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2017/) and [2018](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2018/), I am not going to break this tradition so I would like to share some personal thoughts this year too. The end of a December is a fantastic opportunity to slow down, enjoy Christmas with family, hang out with closest friends, summarize achievements and failures of the last period and think about goals for the upcoming year. A year ago I committed myself to a few goals and despite I didn't manage to tick the box next to every single one of them, this year was great. A lot of accomplishments that I am proud of, some little breakdowns and number of inspirations to keep on working on myself.

## Professional

Looking retrospectively, joining [Mindera]() in [2018](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2018/#professional) was one of the best decisions of my life. I am extremely privileged to have an opportunity to work with a bunch of the most talented programmers under the sun. People who I work with, apart from being ridiculously skilled are also funny, helpful, emphatic friends and I would like to thank every single one of you for being you.

It was a cloudy February afternoon when I picked up a phone call from my good friend [Tiago Nunes](https://twitter.com/tsbnunes). Simple question…

> Hi dude. Would you like to host an international conference in Portugal?

My answer was also simple — yes! So instead of giving a conference talk like I initially planned, on Friday 29th of March, I stood on an [Alfândega do Porto](https://www.ccalfandegaporto.com/en/) stage in front of hundreds of people being an MC of a [typeof](https://typeofconf.com) conference. It was an unforgettable experience and you better stay tuned because the continuation of this story is coming shorty next year.

After a few years of working on the web platform as a front end developer, this year threw me on the deep end of backend. I am currently working on a transition from monolithic, outdated codebase to modern, server-less architecture on the AWS platform for a huge UK based client (sorry, cannot reveal a name). Now I am extremely happy to have an opportunity to embrace the web from the server-side perspective but the first few months were not smooth. Being surrounded by engineers familiar with all the concepts that I have never heard of wasn't fun. My understanding of the new environment quickly improved. I learned to use the fact that I work with much more experienced programmers than myself as an opportunity to learn instead of using it as a trigger to burnout or depression. I am glad and confident to say that I am a much better programmer than I use to be twelve months ago.

Some people associate professional life with everything between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. That't not the case for me. To be honest I manage to accomplish the best piece of productive work outside of this boundaries. Thing that I am very proud of that has been created outside of my day-to-day job is the website that you are reading now. It exploded this year and it is bigger than ever before counting around 8 thousands unique visitors in average every single day. I published around 30 articles this year, some of them didn't get any traction at all some of them literally exploded. Overall it was another fantastic year for me being a contributor to the open web platform and I would like to thank my readers so much.

## Personal

People say that a "change" is a good ting, but I am glad that not a lot changed in my [personal life since the last year](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2018/#personal) — I am still a truly happy man. I am always surrounded by bunch of good friends who I always can count on. Despite some relationship ups and downs, [Zuzanna](http://zuzannarupinska.com) keeps tolerating her boyfriend pretty well. Our household recently welcomed this little princess — her name is Yoko, she is messy as f**k, doesn't like tuna but loves jumping on my face. Most charming pussycat ever!

Life would be terribly boring living in a break-neck pacing software industry without some non-technical passions. I neglected my passion to cycling for few years and this year it has been reborn. Bunch of friends, hilly north England and my beloved titanium Planet X gravel bike is everything I need after a hard week spent in the maze of code. Feel free to follow my trips on [Strava]() and [Komoot]() and join use whenever you fancy to smash some milage on muddy wilds.

Now probably the part that I am the proudest off — material goods and social media is my bullshit of the past. I don't throw money on announced yesterday MacBook anymore — one I have got does the job. I don't need dozens pair of sneakers anymore because the only pair of comfortable running Nike shoes is all I need. Social media are cool as long as the connect people but I am not going to scroll through the pictures of your boobs or vegan gluten-free burgers when having a relaxed bath. Removing those two things from my life made a big difference and I highly encourage you trying it yourself. Less things — more money. Less pictures of gluten-free shit — more time. As simple as that!

## In 2020 I will…
