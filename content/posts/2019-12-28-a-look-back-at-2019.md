Intro 

## Professional

- transition from frontend to backend and gaining a new experience
- hosting an international conference typeof conference with Tiago
- mindera is a fantastic company and i absolutely love every single person who i work with
- littler burnout when i ended up working with people much more experienced in new for me filed, but quickly realized it is just an opportunity to lean from them not too be jealous about their skills

## Personal

- for a first time since i moved to uk i think about coming back to my home where my family lives
- passion to cycling and photography reborn
- made some great friends who i care about and i am sure they do care about me too
- i have a cat
- i stopped to care about material goods â€” i have 4 years old computer (not even mine but Minderas), i didn't buy new iPhone and i didn't spend a single pound on black Friday

## Plans for 2019

- redesign of this website
- i am fucking old, time to make some concrete steps in my life
