How do we know what we know about such distant subjects like the Big Bang, a distant space or black holes? How much science explored the universe, and what still can be discovered? We know that atoms and particles are tiny, but how small they really are? Luckily Bill Bryson in his book ["A Short History of Nearly Everything"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything), explains it all very well.

“A Short History of Nearly Everything” by Bill Bryson is a scientific book written by a non-scientific author, making the knowledge it contains easily accessible to the general public. It covers many facts from archaeology, anthropology, mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics. If it sounds like something that put you to sleep, trust me, it is not one of these.

Keep in mind that [the audio version of this book on Audiable](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B004EXKR34) is significantly abridged compared to a paper copy. I enjoyed it a lot, but for sure, one day, I will read the original full-blown version.
