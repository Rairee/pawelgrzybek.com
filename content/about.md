title: About
---

Coming from a background in photography, I have progressed through UI/UX design, front-end development to high performing micro-service architectures. Over time I have become involved in the open-source community, frequently attend conferences and follow other like-minded geeks. When I'm not learning or working on another blog post, I indulge my passion for jazz and funk music that helps me maintain a balance between my virtual and real life.
