The fact that the CSSOM View spec is a draft isn’t relevant, since that’s the standard format in which CSS modules are developed; what matters is how many browser engines support a given feature. In this case, the support from Chrome and Firefox pretty much ensures that the other two engines will implement it eventually, and in the meantime, there’s the polyfill.</p>",

It really can’t get any better than that.</p><p>Yes, the feature is basic, but that’s a good thing. Simpler features are easier to implement, which allows the web platform to move forward in small steps, instead of having a more complex feature scrapped because browsers couldn’t agree on the functionality. Smooth scrolling is valuable even in this most-basic form.</p>",

It aims to move things to particular place, it may do something for some period of time, it may aim to reach some position...</p><p>This one liner checks it <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> achieved it's aim.

        "comment": "<p>Paweł, your solution is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much! But I think that I have found a little bug that was appearing in Chrome browser (did not check other browsers). Basically I could not scroll from section 2, 3 or higher back to section 1. It was scrolling up and then jumping back to section that I was before calling scroll.  I think it is because Chrome uses float value for document.body.scrollTop. I found solution for this bug and now it works perfectly. I just had to change `if (body.scrollTop === destination) ` into `if (Math.ceil(body.scrollTop) === destination)`<br>Pozdrowienia z Polski :)</p>",

A smooth scroll in 100 lines of code instead of having a jquery library as a dependency.<br>It works like a charm in linux and mac but on windows it is not, even tho i read all the comments and the possible solutions. First bug is that when I click on the links I cannot scroll from the mouse and the second bug i cant scroll to home(top section), in both there is an infinite loop.

        "comment": "<p>Thank you for that great piece of code.</p><p>We unfortunately experienced some issues regarding scroll targets with float numbers. In cases where the user has zoomed the page, the target can be determined as a float type, which results in a strange behavior as the site get stuck at the desired scroll target. The user can't scroll any further. Firefox can handle float numbers, but Safari start rounding up that numbers and references it internally still as a float. Thus your condition where the callback is triggered at the desired position is never triggered. Our fix was the following snippet, look for the lastScrollPosition variable. We check if the value in 'lastScrollPosition' hasn't changed and in that case we assume that we reached our desired target:</p><p></p><pre><code><br>    var lastScrollPosition;<br><br>    function scroll() {<br><br>        var now = 'now' in window.performance ? performance.now() : new Date().getTime();<br>        var time = Math.min(1, ((now - startTime) / duration));<br>        var timeFunction = easings[easing](time);<br><br>        window.scroll(0, Math.ceil((timeFunction * (destinationOffsetToScroll - start)) + start));<br><br>        /* fix to detect scrolled position to half pixel on browser zoom. */<br><br>        if (lastScrollPosition === window.pageYOffset || Math.abs(lastScrollPosition === window.pageYOffsetwindow.pageYOffset - destinationOffsetToScroll) &lt;= 1) {<br><br>            if (callback) {<br>                callback();<br>            }<br><br>            return;<br><br>        }<br><br>        lastScrollPosition = window.pageYOffset;<br>        requestAnimationFrame(scroll);<br><br>    }<br><br></code><br></pre>",

And then I installed Gulp simply with sudo. After wasting 4 hours trying to install Gulp without sudo, I got Gulp working in under 5 minutes with sudo and was well on my way to finally figuring out how to use Gulp. Infuriating.</p><p>When I bounce around different links like these (recommended by a SitePoint Premium tutorial on Front End development, btw), I quickly realize that the comments sections on all these articles are FULL of people more advanced than me who are just blindly copy-pasting whatever anyone tells them to try. This is such a moronic way to work. Why hasn't Microsoft or Apple created a simply installer for build tools that actually works without so much wasted time? CodeKit had the right idea and I think at this point there are enough examples out there with Gulp and Webpack that any big company knows what they need to do.</p>",

        "comment": "<p>There's a difference between root owning files and a \"server running with root priviledges\".</p><p>The ownership of the process is determined by who runs the executable, irrespective of the owner of the file.</p><p>If you sudo the npm install, the installation scripts have root privs - a security risk.  You're running someone else's code as root.  But the installed executables will run with the permissions of whoever runs them.</p><p>Conversely, if you set permissions of your global NPM package dir to yourself, so that you don't have to sudo install, then anything malicious run by you can change the content of binaries - a security risk.  That's why binaries in *nix are usually owned by root, but with global read and execute permissions.</p><p>So, there are security risks with both schemes.</p>",

The path it returns is what you should type into the config file in SublimeText. For me it was \"C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe\". If \"where node\" complains about not being found, you should download nodejs from <a title=\"nodejs.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"http://nodejs.org\">nodejs.org</a> (then use the above steps to point sublime to the installed exe).</p>",

When I test with http://localhost, I first ran into  403 You don't have permission to access / on this server. After fix that by enabling &lt;directory/&gt;Require all granted&lt;/directory&gt;, I then ran into a 404 error. That was fixed by change the apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file and replace the DocumentRoot with the directory of my own. So, in the end, my final set up was to leave out the steps \"CHANGE THE DEFAULT LOCATION FOR OUR PROJECTS\" and \"ENABLE .HTACCESS\", go straight to /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, edit the block to add the following info. Hope this will help others who might ran into the same issue.

You should do the same for types as well, as a type is a definition of a type of data that can be declared and assigned.</p><p>Many people use interfaces as types, which isn't strictly the correct way to use them, certainly not in other languages anyways.</p><p><b>Using a type the correct way</b><br><code><br>type Communication = string | { message: string };<br><br>const comm1: Communication = 'lol';<br>const comm2: Communication = { message: 'lol' };<br></code></p><p><b>Using a type the wrong way</b><br><code><br>type Contract = {<br>    message: string;<br>    print: Function;<br>}<br>// This is syntactically correct, but since when do people implement a type?<br>// you declare and instantiate types, we implement interfaces as that's the purpose of polymorphism!<br>class MessageContract implements Contract {<br>    constructor(public message: string) { }<br>    print() {<br>        console.log(this.message);<br>    }<br>}<br></code></p><p><b>Using an interface the correct way by defining an interface and implementing it in a class</b><br><code><br>interface Contract {<br>    message: string;<br>    print: Function;<br>}<br><br>class Messager implements Contract {<br>    constructor(public message: string) { }<br>    print() {<br>        console.log(this.message);<br>    }<br>}<br><br>const messager = new Messager('Hello World!);<br>messager.print();<br></code></p><p><b>Using an interface the incorrect way by using it as a type</b><br><code><br>interface Messager {<br>  print: Function;<br>}<br><br>const messager: Messager = {<br>  print: () =&gt; {<br>    console.log('Hello!')<br>  }<br>}<br><br>messager.print();<br></code></p><p>I personally think the only other appropriate usage of an interface is to define the shape of arguments to a function as this is still technically a contract or promise of a data shape that the function expects.</p><p><code><br>interface PropTypes {<br>  name: string;<br>  age: number;<br>}<br><br>const funkyFunc = (props: PropTypes) =&gt; {<br>  const { name, age } = props;<br>  console.log(`Hello ${name}, you're ${age} old!`);<br>}<br></code></p><p>Another key difference not expanded on enough imho is the deferred type resolution of interfaces. Interfaces can extend classes as well as types. The interface will inherit the properties and their types of a class when this is done which is super neat, I guess it's the point of what you're saying?</p><p>Types can't do this at all.</p><p><code><br>class Messager {<br>  sayHello() {<br>    console.log('Hello!);<br>  }<br>}<br><br>interface AwesomeMessager extends Messager {<br>  name: string;<br>}<br><br>class MessageLogger implements AwesomeMessager {<br>  constructor(public name: string) {}<br>  sayHello() {<br>    console.log(`Hello ${this.name}!`);<br>  }<br>}<br></code></p><p>Anyway, great article and keep 'em coming 💪</p>",

For example, do you have a seperate bucket for each year, or each month in a year, etc.?<br>2) Is there any benefit of choosing servers geographically closest to you, or should I just choose the cheapest one (N. Virginia). It would seem that the point is never to access the data unless in an emergency. So the server proximity would be irrelevant?<br>3) Do you have any trouble uploading large files, such as a video that is several gigabytes? Would aws cli serve to sync large files (`aws s3 sync . s3://whatever`)?<br>4) Roughly how much data are you storing, is it terabytes? You said 200gb at the start, but is that still true with your a7r3? Is the system scaling to handle this extra data? What kind of upload speed do you have to handle this? I have lots of data ...</p><p>Sorry for all the questions!</p>",

There is no reason why I picked my local one apart from habit. All my S3 instances are in London ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>3.<br>Cannot help with this one because I have never tried sending big files like this. Sorry.</p><p>4.<br>I currently have around 250GB. I add new folders every so often and it scales really well for me. My sessions folders are not huge tho, between 3GB to 15GB. It goes really quick for me. Cannot give you a number but I can give approx comparison — Dropbox upload is  million times slower than this one.

One of the things you don't mention is if the pricing for S3 Standard is prorated (a comment below asks, but not necessarily in a clear way). If I understand correctly, if you upload a file to S3 standard, you pay for a month's worth of its storage, regardless of whether you lifecycle it to Glacier 1 day later or 30 days. Has this been your experience? Or are you charged a prorated cost for S3 Standard depending on how long the file \"sits\" there?</p><p>Another point: it is apparently possible to upload directly to Glacier Deep (PUT costs more, but you presumably save the cost of S3 Standard). The flipside is that, apparently, it is command-line only. Have you tried this? etc :)</p>",

If I found it earlier, it could have saved me some time reading AWS docs and watching lengthy youtube videos :) Still, using IAM properly is something I haven't gotten into yet.</p><p>One important thing I would add is AWS has very flexible server-side (and client-side) encryption settings for protecting data at rest. You can either manage keys yourself via using client-side encryption and uploading already encrypted data, or let AWS manage encryption server-side. The latter has at least two options: generate and use your own encryption keys via AWS KMS (Key Management Service), or let AWS manage the encryption automatically in the background without you needing to do anything (<a title=\"https://youtu.be/VC0k-noNwOU?t=2089)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/VC0k-noNwOU?t=2089)\">https://youtu.be/VC0k-noNwO...</a>.</p><p>I'm not sure the server-side encryption is on by default though, and I think I had to specifically enable it in bucket settings, but it's there and it's as simple as turning it on. This way your girlfriend's photos are safe from anyone's, even the employee's eyes! :)</p>",

        "comment": "<p>Thanks for the helpful article. I was looking into AWS for work and likewise thought maybe should expand my backups to use AWS rather than just a NAS and on site backup. However one point to consider is the fact that I got numerous warnings about how Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive are charged. Not only per request, but also per file, additional storage is required and it is very very hard to work out just what this means as far as $$ is concerned. Also I read each type has a minimum time of storage and you will be charged if you delete earlier than that time, which for GDA is 6 months. I have over 100,000 photos I was going to simply replicate to S3 and then push to GDA. I am now thinking that is a very bad idea and that I should perhaps zip them up or something but that creates additional problems around how many versions do you keep, how often you update, when do you delete, etc. I suggest that is why \"simpler\" options like Dropbox, Google, Drive, etc are popular as you just buy a bucket of storage and can upload, add, change, etc as much as you like without fear of racking up a large bill. If you know what you are doing and can understand the complicated charging model then perhaps S3 &amp; AWS might work out cheaper.. but it could cost you a lot more as well!</p>",

I use it to host two static websites as well. There are easy to use GUIs (Transmit on Mac, Cloudberry Explorer on PC, Cyberduck, Filezilla, others both paid and \"free\") and the command line is easy to use with a wee bit of learning and patience. (It will be familiar to anyone who has worked with Linux.)</p><p>Your reminder to set up users beyond root is timely. I have neglected this but understand its importance. I have never explored Glacier but will look into it. Seems simple enough. One thing I've begun doing is backing up photos and other files directly from Android  phone to S3 buckets. Haven't found a way to automate this though.</p><p>So called \"power users\" and IT folks are familiar with AWS, but it's a best kept secret for the rest of us that deserves to be shared.</p><p>By the way, Happy New Year!</p>",

This is not an issue for small amount of objects. Good idea to compress and package objects in single file (per year for example).</p><p>3) Also consider the traffic especially out one, those will be chargeable</p><p>4) Consider to use US region to host your S3 than one close to you, all regions in US are the cheapest.

        "comment": "<p>Ah I love it! I also went down this road and never looked back (actually that is a lie, I did try a couple of other options later on to see if they compare, and ended up returning everything to S3 haha).</p><p>Thanks for putting this information up here. I also remember being completely overwhelmed at first with the AWS offerings (and back then there was no snowmobile!). Loads of people will find this helpful!</p><p>One thing I'd like to add, if/when wanting to take things further is to consider git-annex. It's something I've been using for a long time as well, with S3 as the storage backend, and it provides some things I've never seen anything else achieve elsewhere.</p><p>Unfortunately it does add more complexity, as you'd be learning just the basics of git, and then the basics of git-annex on top of all the S3 stuff above (though it does have an automated sync tool which can make a lot of this point and click!). But that is the theme of this post! Huzzah!</p><p>Ultimately the tool manages metadata and filenames, and treats them separate from their content. Which maybe sounds small or confusing, and it is at first. But once you get used to it it's huge!</p><p> It means you can move files around in their structure, rename them, even copy them, and they'll only be stored in S3 once without alteration.</p><p>But most importantly for me, it keeps track of your data locations, and lets you drop and retrieve the content of your files easily.</p><p>For example; I can ask it where a photo exists, and it knows that I have a copy of a photo on S3, and another copy on an external HD and another on my laptop.</p><p>Because there is a separation of files and their content, I can drop a file I don't need right now (the tool will confirm there is still a copy around at least before allowing it), and what I'll get in the end is essentially an empty file of the same name as a placeholder. So I can still see my files, their structure, and what I have available. But I don't have to have all the \"content\" of those files around at all times.</p><p>Git itself can be stored and hosted cheaply through AWS, so the whole package can live there.</p><p>The list of other things you can do is a mile long, but some others of note:</p><p>* It can handle encryption, so everything you put into S3 is encrypted if you so choose, even to amazon itself.<br>* If can add another layer of metadata on top of your files managed in the tool itself. Then you can use that as search criteria in other commands, and even dynamically restructure the layout into temporary metadata driven views (think tagging people in photos, then dynamically restructuring the layout so all photos of people are in folders of their name, then switching it back as it was as if nothing happened).<br>* It can add multiple \"backends\" that include S3 but don't have to be. You can even store data in different cloud services and access them all from one place if you like. Moving them between services as you see fit (they all have free plans up to like 5gb right? :P ).<br>* Because it uses git as the backbone for syncing all the metadata and location info. You have all the knowledge completely offline. So you could check where a file lives, for instance, on a laptop offline on a beach somewhere, if you so desired. :P</p><p>Sorry that became a large ramble, and I ended up removing a number of other features I also use for space, haha.</p><p>Back to the regularly scheduled awesome tutorial!</p>",

It generally has the same convenience features that bash has, but it doesn't use readline, which means that shared library's configuration file (~/.inputrc) won't work.  It also has a more screen oriented usage for completion as opposed to a command-line oriented method (which might be more to some people's taste).  However, bash is released under the GPLv3, which says you can't use it on a system that prevents the installation of 3rd party software -- a practice that Apple has been getting closer to for a decade or so.  And, this: \"between MacOS 10.5 Leopard and MacOS 10.12 Sierra, the number of GPL-licensed packages that came pre-installed on macs decreased by an insane 66 percent – from 47 to just 16.\" ref: <a title=\"https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/06/04/why-does-macos-catalina-use-zsh-instead-of-bash-licensing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/06/04/why-does-macos-catalina-use-zsh-instead-of-bash-licensing/\">https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/06/04/why-does-macos-catalina-use-zsh-instead-of-bash-licensing</a></p>",

With everything being in soft pastel colors (which is lovely), the comments are too similar a hue. Granted it might be because I'm somewhat colorblind, so it might be a personal preference.</p><p>Is it possible you could confirm the line where I can edit the color prefs for comments to make an adjustment for my own personal preference?</p><p>Thanks :)</p>",

For personal website like this one, you are right, I don't care too much about stats. If you run a web business it is crucial to measure and reflect on it so some sort of analytics is needed :( I agree with the part about the meaningless analytics coming from 3rd party scripts — luckily some server-side analytics exist. Like \"Netlify Analytics\" — there is no JS script on the frontend and all date comes purely from DNS resolution tracking.</p><p><b>\"just use the right\"</b></p><p>Yes 🙏</p><p>Have a lovely weekend @zakius:disqus</p>",

Thankfully I'm not asked to use C++ too often (maybe a few times per-year), but you're doing well if you understand the JS codebases.</p><p>I Have to put most open source code through `gcc -E` so that I can be sure I'm not mis-understanding its use of macro's and templates. Things have improved in C and C++ since the days when core types could be ambiguous, but it still seems like you'd need 3 screens. One to run a thing, one to develop and another to reference esoteric parts of the code.</p><p>For resources I've quite enjoyed Kate Gregory talks YouTube (free) &amp; courses on Pluralsight (paid). It would be wonderful if I stuck with C++ this time, but I doubt I will. I like having high-level features designed by teams to use. Not having them can feel like treading through mudflats.</p><p>Look forward to reading some insightful articles on C++ from you.</p>",

Later versions of OSX have the ability to have 2 apps \"maximized\" next to each other, this is the equivalent to a long press on the green window button.</p><p>3. Many window managers have a way of moving the active window to the next display. So in a two monitor setup you can move the window to the next display, often you can choose if it moves it to the display to the left or the display to the right (only really useful if you have &gt;2 displays)</p>",

Some of them are built with the latest node runtime, some of server-less lambda stuff that I work on is on 8.10. The ease of switching versions is extremely convenient. Other than that and if you always work with the latest version I would suggest being stick to `brew install node`.</p><p>Have a great day 🥑</p>",

My only concern about Sass is the abstraction of my stylesheets that went too far. I think that PostCSS will help to simplify things a lot. Sass comes with huge power, but because feature exists it doesn't mean that we need to use it. PostCSS gives us ability to strip it down to bare minimum and I like it.</p><p>I'm curious about future development of Sass and PostCSS. PostCSS is better day by day, Sass every update gives us a tons of new features. CSS modules (separation rules from global scope) are another player that we need to pay attention for.</p><p>Will see Lasse, will see...</p>",

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually\".</p><p>Right now, SASS or LESS provides you right out of the box with everything you might need to do any type of project. Speed problems? Use libsass, it's written in C.</p><p>Now, what I do like about PostCSS is the fact that provides us with modularity and granularity. What this does is provide the developer with an elevated level of customization that's starting to be of use. E.G. Say you are building an exp. site that works on both dev versions of Chrome and Firefox... Then you go ahead and build your css with native css variables!</p><p>Which reminds me how happy I was when I found Babel, not just for the fact that I get to write ES6 every day now, that's not even the point, but rather that I get to ditch say jQuery promises in favour of the future Promises/A+ impl, as it up to the dev to decide what goes into your polyfilling and how it does it.</p><p>Lastly, let us not forget that a huge number of improvements into existing web languages went thru thanks to pre-processors and supersets. CoffeeScript arrows inspired ES6 arrows, LESS variables CSS ones... IMHO we should stop calling things \"hype\", and name them \"this idea isn't new, but it's worth reading in order to stir your thoughts a bit\".</p>",
